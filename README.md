# portfolio-xp
This project is an interactive web portfolio in the style of and inspired by Windows XP. It is currently a work-in-progress as I continue to develop my skills in React.

## Future State
Some features I intend to add:
 - Interactive Start Menu
 - Dock Items (minimization)
 - Window Prioritization (layering)
 - Desktop selection tool
 - Notification pop-ups in style of WXP
 - Windows XP boot screen loader
 - Windows XP sounds

## Known Bugs
A few things I am working/hoping to fix:
 - Cannot deselect icons/can select multiple icons
 - Maximize icon does not change once window is fullscreen
 - Pointer cursor is OS default
 - Default cursor is too large
 - Icons shift with window opening
